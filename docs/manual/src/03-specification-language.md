# Specification language

To extend Bombadil with domain-specific knowledge, you write specifications.
These are plain TypeScript or JavaScript [modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that use the library provided by
Bombadil to export *properties* and *action generators*.

Here's how you run Bombadil with a custom specification:

::: browser
```bash
bombadil browser test https://example.com example.ts
```
:::

::: terminal
```bash
bombadil terminal test --specification=example.ts example-command
```
:::

For a full listing of CLI options, see [the reference](#command-line-interface).

## Structure

A specification is a regular ES module. The following examples use TypeScript,
but you may also write them in JavaScript. If you do use TypeScript, you'll
want to install the types from [@antithesishq/bombadil](#typescript-support).

Both properties and action generators are exposed to Bombadil as exports:

```typescript
export const myProperty = ...; 

export const myAction = ...;
```

You may split up your specification into multiple modules and structure it the
way you like, but the top-level specification you give to Bombadil must only
export properties and action generators.

## Importing modules and files

You can split your specification up into multiple modules and import them from
the top level specification module:

```typescript
import { thing } from "./lib/thing.ts";
```

If you install packages from NPM or similar, you may import those too:

```typescript
import equal from "deep-equal";
```

The runtime is limited, so many existing packages might not work, e.g. if they
import NodeJS packages.

### Non-code files

You can import JSON, text, or binary data. This is useful for bootstrapping
tests with reference data, dictionaries, configuration, etc. Use ES import
attributes to specify the type of import:

```typescript
import data from "./fixtures/data.json" with { type: "json" };
import contents from "./wordlist.txt" with { type: "text" };
import raw from "./snapshot.dat" with { type: "binary" };
```

When using `"text"`  you get a `string`, and when using `"binary"` you get
`Uint8Array`.

For JSON data, you can also just use the file extension:

```typescript
import data from "./fixtures/data.json";
```

## Default properties and action generators

::: browser
Bombadil comes with a set of default properties and action generators that work
for most web applications. You'll probably want to reexport all or at least
most of these:

```typescript
export * from "@antithesishq/bombadil/browser/defaults";
```
:::

::: terminal
Bombadil comes with a set of default properties and action generators for
terminal testing. You'll probably want to reexport all or at least most of
these:

```typescript
export * from "@antithesishq/bombadil/terminal/defaults";
```
:::

In fact, these defaults are exactly what are used when running tests without a custom
specification file. If you want to selectively pick just a subset of these,
replace the `*` with the relevant names:

::: browser
```typescript
export { 
    // Properties
    noUncaughtExceptions,
    // Actions
    clicks, 
    reload,
} from "@antithesishq/bombadil/browser/defaults";
```
:::

::: terminal
```typescript
export {
    // Properties
    exitSuccess,
    noReplacementChars,
    // Actions
    typeBasicInput,
} from "@antithesishq/bombadil/terminal/defaults";
```
:::

You may freely combine defaults with your own properties and action generators.
All properties and action generators exported by the top-level module are
used by Bombadil.

::: browser
The browser defaults include properties checking for uncaught exceptions,
unhandled promise rejections, error logs, HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses, and more.
On the actions side, there are generators for general navigation and
interaction with semantic HTML elements.
:::

::: terminal
The terminal defaults are rather simple: things like expecting the
program to terminate with exit code 0 and not print byte sequences that the
terminal can't handle properly. You likely want to extend the defaults with a 
custom specification.
:::

## Language features

The specification language of Bombadil, embedded in TypeScript or JavaScript,
has a small set of central concepts. This section describes them in detail.

### Properties

A property is a description of how the system under test should behave *in
general*. This is different from example-based testing (e.g. [Playwright,
Cypress, or Selenium]{.browser}[TUI snapshot testing]{.terminal}) where you
describe how it behaves for *particular* cases.

The most intuitive kind of property, which you might have come across before,
is an *invariant*: a condition that should always be true. In Bombadil,
invariants are expressed using the `always` temporal operator:

```typescript
always( 
    // some condition that should always be true
)
```

To instruct Bombadil to check your property, you must export it from your
specification module. Its name is used in error reports, so give the
export a meaningful name.

```typescript
export const hasTitle = always( 
    // check that there's a title rendered somehow
);
```

You may export multiple properties, including the
[defaults](#default-properties-and-action-generators), and they'll all be
checked independently. But how do you "check that there's a title
somehow"? You need access to the [browser]{.browser}[terminal]{.terminal}, and for that, you use *extractors*.

### Extractors

In order to describe a condition about the web page you're testing, you first
need to extract state. This is done with the `extract` function,
[which runs inside the browser on every state that Bombadil decides to capture.]{.browser}
[which runs on every state that Bombadil decides to capture.]{.terminal}

```typescript
extract(state => ...)
```
You give it a function that takes the current browser state as an argument, and
returns JSON-serializable data. [The state object contains a bunch of things,
but the most important are `document` and `window` --- the same ones you have access
to in JavaScript running in a browser.]{.browser}[The state object exposes the rendered screen
contents, the cursor position, and other observable signals.]{.terminal}

::: browser
To extract the title, you'd define this at the top level of your specification:

```typescript
const title = extract(state => state.document.title || "");
```
:::

::: terminal
To extract the title from the first row of the terminal grid, you'd define this 
at the top level of your specification:

```typescript
const title = extract(state => state.grid.rowText(0).trim());
```
:::

The `title` value is not a `string` though --- it's a `Cell<string>`, a
stateful value that changes over time. For every new state captured by
Bombadil, the extractor function gets run, and the cell is updated with its
return value.

Using the `title` cell, you can define the property:

```typescript
export const hasTitle = always(() => 
    title.current !== ""
);
```

Two things to note about this example:

1. The expression passed to `always` is a function that takes no arguments ---
   a *thunk*. This is because it needs to be evaluated in every state. It needs
   to *always* be true, not just once, and that's why you need to supply the
   thunk rather than a `boolean`.
2. To get the `string` value out of the cell, you use `.current`.

This is a custom property using the *temporal* operator called `always`.
There are other temporal operators, described in [Formulas](#formulas) below.

### Formulas

Formulas and temporal operators may sound scary, but fear not --- they are
essentially ways of expressing "conditions over time". Here are some quick
facts about formulas and temporal operators:

* Temporal operators return formulas. 
* Every property in Bombadil is a formula (of the `Formula` type). 
* A temporal operator is a function that takes some subformula and evaluates it
  over time. 
* Different temporal operators evaluate their subformulas in different ways.
* Bombadil evaluates formulas against a sequence of states to check if they
  *hold true*.

Temporal operator types include `always`, as discussed in the example in [Extractors](#extractors) above, and also `eventually` and `next`. Here's an
informal[^ltl] description of how they work:

* `always(x)` holds if `x` holds in *this* and *every future* state
* `next(x)` holds if `x` holds in *the next* state
* `eventually(x)` holds if `x` holds in *this* or *any future* state

They accept *subformulas* as arguments. You'll notice in the example with
`always` above, the argument was a thunk. This still works, because the operators
automatically convert thunks into formulas. In fact, there's an operator for doing that
explicitly, called `now`:

```typescript
always(now(() => title.current !== ""))
```

You normally don't have to use the `now` operator, unless you want to use
*logical connectives* at the formula level. They are defined as methods on
formulas:

* `x.and(y)` holds if `x` holds and `y` holds
* `x.or(y)` holds if `x` holds or `y` holds
* `x.implies(y)` holds if `x` doesn't hold or `y` holds

There's also negation, both as a function and as a method on
formulas, i.e. `not(x)` and `x.not()`.

::: browser
The `now` operator is useful when expressing single-state preconditions. The
following property checks that pressing a button shows a spinner that is
eventually hidden again:

```typescript
const buttonPressed = extract(() => ...);
const spinnerVisible = extract(() => ...);

now(() => buttonPressed.current).implies(
    now(() => spinnerVisible.current)
        .and(eventually(() => !spinnerVisible.current))
)
```
:::

::: terminal
The `now` operator is useful when expressing single-state preconditions. The
following property checks that submitting a command shows a loading indicator
that is eventually hidden:

```typescript
const commandSubmitted = extract(() => ...);
const loadingShown = extract(() => ...);

now(() => commandSubmitted.current).implies(
    now(() => loadingShown.current)
        .and(eventually(() => !loadingShown.current))
)
```
:::

You can build more advanced formulas, and even include nested temporal operators, but
the basics are often powerful enough. See the [examples](#examples) at the bottom for more
inspiration.

### Action generators

In addition to exporting properties in a specification, you export action
generators. A generator is an object with a `generate()` method. An action
generator generates values of type `Tree<Action>`.

Like with [default properties](#default-properties-and-action-generators),
there are default actions provided by Bombadil. These will get you a long way,
but there are times where you'll need to define your own action generators.

For every state that Bombadil captures, all action generators are run, contributing
to a tree structure of *possible* actions. Bombadil then randomly picks one in that
tree. Why a tree, though? It's because the branches are *weighted* --- equally, by default.
But you can override this to control the probability of
an action being picked.

To define a custom action generator, you use the `actions` function, which
takes a thunk that returns an array of actions:

```typescript
export const myAction = actions(() => {
    return [
        ...
    ];
});
```

In the returned array, each element is a value of the following `Action` type,
provided by [the NPM package](#typescript-support):

::: browser
<!-- TODO: link to `Action` type when we have generated TypeScript reference rather than hard coding it here -->
```typescript
interface Point {
    x: number;
    y: number;
}

type Action =
    | "Back"
    | "Forward"
    | "Reload"
    | "Wait"
    | { Click: { name: string; content?: string; point: Point } }
    // Many others...
    ;
```

Here's a generator for clicks in the center of a `canvas` element:

```typescript
const canvasCenter = extract((state) => {
    const canvas = state.document.querySelector("#my-canvas");
    if (!canvas) {
        return null;
    }
    const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
    if (rect.width > 0 && rect.height > 0) {
        return {
            x: rect.left + rect.width / 2,
            y: rect.top + rect.height / 2,
        };
    }
    return null;
});


export const clickCanvas = actions(() => {
    const point = canvasCenter.current;
    return point ? [{ Click: { name: "canvas", point } }] : [];
});
```

For double-click actions, specify the delay between clicks in milliseconds (0-1000ms):

```typescript
export const doubleClickCanvas = actions(() => {
    const point = canvasCenter.current;
    return point ? [{
        DoubleClick: {
            name: "canvas",
            point,
            delayMillis: 100,
        }
    }] : [];
});
```
:::

::: terminal
<!-- TODO: link to `Action` type when we have generated TypeScript reference rather than hard coding it here -->
```typescript
export type Action =
  | { TypeText: { text: string } }
  | { PressKey: { code: number } }
  | { Resize: { size: Size } }
  | { ScrollUp: {} }
  | { ScrollDown: {} };
```

Here's a generator that sends a single `help` command:

```typescript
export const sendHelp = actions(() => {
    return [{ TypeText: { text: "help\n" } }];
});
```
:::

The actions you return must be possible to perform in the current state. Your
action generators should therefore depend on [cells](#extractors) and validate
your actions before returning them[, as done with `canvasCenter` in the previous
example. Another example is the `back` action generator provided by Bombadil,
which checks that there's a history entry to go back to, otherwise returning `[]`]{.browser}.

To give actions different weights, use the `weighted` combinator and wrap each
subgenerator in an array with the weight as the first element:

::: browser
```typescript
export const navigation = weighted([
    [10, back],
    [1, forward],
    [1, reload],
]);
```
:::

::: terminal
```typescript
export const inputs = weighted([
  [10, typeFromSet(CharSets.UNICODE_SAFE)],
  [1, typeFromSet(CharSets.CONTROL_COMMON)],
]);
```
:::

## Examples

::: browser
These are full, runnable examples of properties and action generators you might
need in your own testing with Bombadil. Think of them as design patterns for
properties. Each example is a self-contained specification file.

### Invariant: max notification count

This is a simple property checking that there are never more than five notifications
shown.

```typescript
import { extract, always } from "@antithesishq/bombadil";
export * from "@antithesishq/bombadil/browser/defaults";

const notificationCount = extract((state) => 
    state.document.body.querySelectorAll(".notification").length,
);

export const max_notifications_shown = always(() =>
    notificationCount.current <= 5,
);
```

### Sliding window: constant notification count

This property checks that the notification count doesn't change --- that it is
the same as in the first state. Note how this property evaluates
`notificationCount.current` in the outer thunk, and then uses that in the
inner thunk to compare against the current value.

```typescript
import { extract, always, now, time } from "@antithesishq/bombadil";
export * from "@antithesishq/bombadil/browser/defaults";

const notificationCount = extract((state) =>
    state.document.body.querySelectorAll(".notification").length,
);

export const constantNotificationCount = now(() => {
    const initial = notificationCount.current;
    return always(() => 
        notificationCount.current === initial,
    );
});
```

### Guarantee: error disappears

A *guarantee property* checks that something good eventually happens, within
some time bound. Here is a property that checks that error messages disappear
within five seconds.

```typescript
import { extract, always, now, eventually } from "@antithesishq/bombadil";
export * from "@antithesishq/bombadil/browser/defaults";

const errorMessage = extract((state) => 
    state.document.body.querySelector(".error")?.textContent ?? null,
);

export const errorDisappears = always(
    now(() => errorMessage.current !== null).implies(
        eventually(() => errorMessage.current === null)
            .within(5, "seconds"),
    ),
);
```

### Contextful guarantee: notification includes past value

This property checks that if there's a non-blank name entered, and
it is submitted, then eventually there will be a notification that includes the
name. This example uses an outer thunk to force a cell value (`nameEntered`) at every
state, and then closes over that value with the inner thunk passed to
`eventually`. 

```typescript
import { extract, always, now, next, eventually } from "@antithesishq/bombadil";
export * from "@antithesishq/bombadil/browser/defaults";

const name = extract((state) => {
    const element = 
        state.document.body.querySelector("#name-field");
    return (element as HTMLInputElement | null)?.value ?? null;
});

const submitInProgress = extract((state) => 
    state.document.body.querySelector("submit.progress")
        !== null,
);

const notificationText = extract((state) =>
    state.document.body.querySelector(".notification")?.textContent 
        ?? null,
);

export const notificationIncludesMessage = always(() => {
    const nameEntered = name.current?.trim() ?? "";

    return now(() => nameEntered !== "")
        .and(next(() => submitInProgress.current))
        .implies(eventually(() => 
            notificationText.current?.includes(nameEntered) 
                ?? false,
        ).within(5, "seconds"));
});
```

### State machine: counter

This property models a counter as a state machine, checking that the counter
only transitions by staying the same, incrementing by 1, or decrementing by 1
(no invalid jumps allowed).

```typescript
import { extract, always, now, next } from "@antithesishq/bombadil";
export * from "@antithesishq/bombadil/browser/defaults";

const counterValue = extract((state) => {
    const element = state.document.body.querySelector("#counter");
    return parseInt(element?.textContent ?? "0", 10);
});

const unchanged = now(() => {
    const current = counterValue.current;
    return next(() => counterValue.current === current);
});

const increment = now(() => {
    const current = counterValue.current;
    return next(() => counterValue.current === current + 1);
});

const decrement = now(() => {
    const current = counterValue.current;
    return next(() => counterValue.current === current - 1);
});

export const counterStateMachine = 
    always(unchanged.or(increment).or(decrement));
```

If this specification exports the `reload` action, the `unchanged` property
becomes relevant.[^stuttering] Unless this application stored the state of the counter
somehow, reloading the page would clear the counter, which this property
would catch as a violation.
